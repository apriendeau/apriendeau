      <description>TLDR; Things are coming together but just wait if you want to use this type of macbook in a Professional development capicity.
*Note: At the time of writing this, Docker was not supported and both Rust and Go would not compile on M1 and were in beta versions.
I had not upgraded my existing macbook in 8 years and Apple finally decided to cut me off from OS upgrades. So naturally, I grabbed an Apple M1 Macbook Air without thinking much.</description>
